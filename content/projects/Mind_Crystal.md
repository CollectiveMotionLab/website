## MindCrystal


Trance rituals connect individuals in a larger group consciousness.
The Collective Motion Laboratory was formed with the goal of exploring the phenomena of this collective consciousness.
Technology and scientific research are used to both study and enhance the power of such liminal experiences.
A set of modules that analyse and broadcast movement or other bio-signals to artists for use in their live performances.

Video module: High-performance infrared video cameras enable data collection in the dark.

MESH module: Wireless movement detection using handheld 9-axis inertial sensors. High performance dedicated WiFi protocol allows high precision synchronous recording of up to 100 movement sensors.

EEG/EKG module: Wireless recording of bio-signals, including electroencephalography (EEG, brain) and electrocardiography (EKG, heart).



All data is sent to a computer for motion processing and signal analysis.
The results are then broadcast to artists for use in their live performances, where they can map the signals using their software to control lasers, sound, video or anything they want.

The Collective Motion Lab will help artists and participants discovering new ways to experience music and collective rituals.
